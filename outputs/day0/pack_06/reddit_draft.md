# Reddit Draft (Pack 06)

**Status**: DRAFT ONLY (Do NOT Auto-post)

## Title Candidates

1. My packing game changed when I stopped packing air.
2. Has anyone else tried compression for winter coats?
3. The real solution to the 'Takes up half the bag.' struggle.

## Body (Value First)

Hey everyone, just wanted to share a small win.
I used to struggle with Takes up half the bag..
Finally tried a Vacuum Bag setup.
The strict rule I follow now: Roll-up vacuum bag (no pump needed)..
It saves so much headache.

(No link here. If asked, I'll DM or put in profile.)
