# Reddit Draft (Pack 04)

**Status**: DRAFT ONLY (Do NOT Auto-post)

## Title Candidates

1. My packing game changed when I stopped packing air.
2. Has anyone else tried compression for winter coats?
3. The real solution to the 'Chargers tangled everywhere.' struggle.

## Body (Value First)

Hey everyone, just wanted to share a small win.
I used to struggle with Chargers tangled everywhere..
Finally tried a Tech Pouch setup.
The strict rule I follow now: Elastic loops for every cable..
It saves so much headache.

(No link here. If asked, I'll DM or put in profile.)
