# Reddit Draft (Pack 03)

**Status**: DRAFT ONLY (Do NOT Auto-post)

## Title Candidates

1. My packing game changed when I stopped packing air.
2. Has anyone else tried compression for winter coats?
3. The real solution to the 'Gross shoe transfers.' struggle.

## Body (Value First)

Hey everyone, just wanted to share a small win.
I used to struggle with Gross shoe transfers..
Finally tried a Shoe Pouch setup.
The strict rule I follow now: Dedicated shoe pouch isolates the dirt..
It saves so much headache.

(No link here. If asked, I'll DM or put in profile.)
