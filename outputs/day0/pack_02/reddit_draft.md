# Reddit Draft (Pack 02)
**Status**: DRAFT ONLY (Do NOT Auto-post)

## Title Candidates
1. My packing game changed when I stopped packing air.
2. Has anyone else tried compression for winter coats?
3. The real solution to the 'Ruined clothes from leaks.' struggle.

## Body (Value First)
Hey everyone, just wanted to share a small win.
I used to struggle with Ruined clothes from leaks..
Finally tried a Toiletry Bag setup.
The strict rule I follow now: Waterproof hanging bag keeps spills contained..
It saves so much headache.

(No link here. If asked, I'll DM or put in profile.)
