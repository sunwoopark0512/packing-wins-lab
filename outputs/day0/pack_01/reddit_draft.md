# Reddit Draft (Pack 01)
**Status**: DRAFT ONLY (Do NOT Auto-post)

## Title Candidates
1. My packing game changed when I stopped packing air.
2. Has anyone else tried compression for winter coats?
3. The real solution to the 'Suitcase won't close?' struggle.

## Body (Value First)
Hey everyone, just wanted to share a small win.
I used to struggle with Suitcase won't close?.
Finally tried a Compression Cubes setup.
The strict rule I follow now: These cubes squash clothes down by 60%..
It saves so much headache.

(No link here. If asked, I'll DM or put in profile.)
