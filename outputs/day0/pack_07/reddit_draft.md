# Reddit Draft (Pack 07)

**Status**: DRAFT ONLY (Do NOT Auto-post)

## Title Candidates

1. My packing game changed when I stopped packing air.
2. Has anyone else tried compression for winter coats?
3. The real solution to the 'Soft bags crush makeup.' struggle.

## Body (Value First)

Hey everyone, just wanted to share a small win.
I used to struggle with Soft bags crush makeup..
Finally tried a Makeup Case setup.
The strict rule I follow now: Hard shell case protects your glow..
It saves so much headache.
